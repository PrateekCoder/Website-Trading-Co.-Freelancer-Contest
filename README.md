Contest Brief
Here are some designs that are similar to what I'm looking for. However, I don't want any colors other than black and white, I don't want any background textures or photos, ignore the navigation bars, since this is only a one page website, and ignore any visual moving effects. I don't need that. Keep in mind that these are just examples, and are NOT exactly what I'm looking for. The main thing that I want you to focus on is the sections. The designers of these sights made each topic of the page into a different section, using background colors, images, and headings. Here are the designs:

Intro:
Design a one page mockup ONLY using Photoshop. The name of the business is "Website Trading Co." We are a website design company, and we offer website design, domain registration, web hosting, and internet marketing.

Key elements:
1) Design the website so that it can be made responsive on mobile devices

Design:
1) The business name is "Website Trading Co." and should reflect an old wild west kind of theme
2) The colors for the website are black and white only, just like the logo
3) The design of the website should match the logo, which is attached to this project
4)The website is only one page, and the customer will scroll to each new section of the website, which should be noticeably different from the last section. Divide the sections using a different background color (black or white), or use borders, boxes, or headings. I'll leave that up to you.

Sections/Content:
Top of page/heading content. At the top of the page, I want my logo, a slogan, and a phone number. The number is (413) 555-5555. The slogan will read, "Incredible value, amazing service!"
1) The first section will cover our special offer. It will read as follows: 
Special offer! FREE domain registration and website hosting for one year with purchase of a new website. I want this offer to be top center of the page (under the logo), and to look like an old newspaper ad. I have included examples of old ads, which are attached as images to this project.
2) The second section will cover website design, and will describe our workflow/design process. It should be explained using graphics and text. The text will read as follows:
Heading: Our design process is simple and fast!
1) Tell us what you want
2) We'll send over several professional designs for you to choose from
3) You pick the design that you like, and tell us if you want any changes made
4) We'll make the final edits, and publish your work to the internet. It's that simple!
3) The third section of the website will cover internet marketing. The text will read as follows:
Heading: Fast, affordable, effective local internet marketing! 
We've partnered with Yext to bring you the best prices and technology to market your business. Yext offers Digital Location Management software and solutions that help you leverage location-based technologies to drive foot traffic in your local stores.

This local internet marketing system is unique, simple, effective, and affordable.

This section should also include the "Yext certified partner" logo. I have included a Yext logo for both white and black backgrounds.

4) The final section should be about us. The text will read as follows.

We work with a team of web designers, graphic designers, programmers, and internet marketing specialists all over the world.
